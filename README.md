Laptop Price Prediction

Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction project! In this repository, we have explored a dataset of laptops, cleaned the data, and built five machine learning models: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. After fine-tuning the models' hyperparameters, we achieved an accuracy of 88%.

Overview

This repository provides insights into the prediction of laptop prices using various machine learning techniques. We have built each model with careful attention to detail to ensure accurate results.

Models Used

- Linear Regression: A basic and commonly used predictive model.
- Lasso Regression: Uses L1 regularization to penalize the absolute size of coefficients.
- Ridge Regression: Uses L2 regularization to penalize the squared size of coefficients.
- Decision Tree: A supervised learning algorithm that partitions the data based on input features.
- Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees during training.

Results and Analysis

Each model's performance has been evaluated, and we have provided detailed insights into their strengths and weaknesses. The notebook includes comparisons between model predictions and actual prices in the dataset.

Conclusion

We hope this project helps you understand laptop price prediction. Feel free to explore, modify the code, and use it for your own projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out. Happy predicting!
